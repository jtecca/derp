* Usage
Example below shows how to spawn a new derp.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setf derp
      (derp:spawn-derp
       (derp:make-derp-config :name "derp"
                              :icon ":robot_face:"
                              :token "YourSlackAPIToken"
                              :id "C01234567"
                              :channel "C01234567"
                              :commands '("cat" "ping" "help"))))
#+END_SRC

And here is just an example how you can start derping...
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(progn
  (derp::get-commands-and-users derp)
  (derp::run-tasks derp)
  (sleep 1))
#+END_SRC

Not the best way but - hey, it works! At least for now...
